        I have succefully converted to sendmail 8.7.3 configuration files
and I saw in S0 the rule for the local domains
R$*<@ $=w .> $*         $#local $:$1 

why not make it

R$*<@ $* . $=w .> $*            $#local $:$1 

in which case you not only receive say 
thisdomain.com but also www.thisdomain.com , ftp.thisdomain.com etc etc
,
it sure works for about 100 or so domains in one setup
The above scheme also evades wildcarded MX records in DNS so that named
does not bitch .

        Ideas , flames , introspcetion ?

I can see a potential problem immediately.

Would this not cause the following problem?

The machine tec.army.mil, at our site, would suddenly accept as local
all mail sent from tec.army.mil addressed to any machine in the domain
tec.army.mil, including /my/ machines, which all masquerade as 
svl.tec.army.mil.

Experiments I did with a test sendmail.cf do show that this way I can 
force mail from tec.army.mil to www.tec.army.mil would be delivered as 
local.  They're not the same machine.

Given that we all have differing user bases, I would consider this a 
Bad Thing (TM).

You might consider creating a class that contains all valid prefixes,
to contain prefixes ftp, www, etc.; however, I say this with the reservation
that the bookkeeping between there and the Cw enumeration runs a high risk of
posing consistency problems.  Given that we can now put class w in a file, 
which can be maintained and checked by perl scripts if they get WAY too complex
(lord, let's hope not) I think keeping it in class w is the way to go.
