<font color=maroon size=+1>The software used to generate these reports  is called <a href="/various/Xray.tar.gz">Xray</a>. Here is the <a href="/various/readme-xray.txt">readme</a> file for the project. You also need the

<b> Tech Notes on Fast Searches </b><p>
The search engine is based on my db based perl search engine. The Xray package
generates 2 files domains_scanned and domains_per_server which are combined
into one database file with <a href="mkd.pl">mkd</a>. This file is in turn used
by the cgi-script <a href="dns-search.pl">dns-search.pl</a> as a persistent hash table.
