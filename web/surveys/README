This is a CGI enguine that turns any ordinary web page into a full blown survey.

It can 


	validate numbers, by checking for valid input as well as checks ranges

	Force respondents to answer a question before progressing

	direct the flow of the survey  depending upon previous answers

	etc. etc.


survey.html is the launcher  
users.hmtl is the survey proper 
nextq.cgi is the engine


you can email me at angelos@unix.gr for support 

****************
* Instructions *
****************

the survey starts with the Tag
<!-- START_SURVEY -->
and ends with the tag 
<!-- END-SURVEY -->

question groups start with 
<!-- START-GROUP X -->
and end with 
<!-- END-GROUP X -->

there is no provision for nested groups , it would be dysfunctional anyway

within the html code you can use tags like 
proceed
setvar
jumpto


here are some examples

<input type="radio" Name="pc" value="386" onclick="proceed()">386

	if you clink on this radio you immediately move to the next question

Other:<input type=text name="pc-other" onchange="setvar('pc','other');setvar('pc','other')">

	typing inside the other box sets also the variable "pc" to "other"

<input type="radio" Name="multiple-users" value="no" onclick="skipto(6)">No<br>

	Clicking on this button will skipp all groups of questions and go to 
	group number 6

Hours Online:<input type="text" Name="Hours-Online" onchange="validate_number('Hours-Online')">

	If you want to check that the user has entered a number and not garbage 
	use the above example


Age (18-45):<input type="text" Name="Age" onchange="number_range_check('Age',18,45)">

	Check that the user has entered a valid number in the range between 18 and 45
