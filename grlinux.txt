I have just uploaded a version of the 437 codepage for greek on sunsite.unc.edu
under pub/Linux/Incoming

All the people out there with vga monitors that are running linux
can now type/read greek.

It requires a kernel > 0.99 probably > 1.00
and the kbd-0.87 package.

Have fun.
  
O btw, can we get this in the technical faq ?
