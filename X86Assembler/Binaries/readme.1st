
			Generic information on VGAGREEK

	    This is the GREEK language support system totally handcrafted
    and home-baked by Angelos Karageorgiou. It supports not only the latest
    ELOT standards on keyboards and ASCII character definitions, but a whole
    range of VGA systems.

	  After the keyboard and screen driver have been loaded one can have
    standard 25 lines, or 28,50,55 or 65 lines of text on a standard VGA screen.
    The programs are called respectively VGA28,VGA50,VGA55 and VGA65.These programs
    have also been tested on VESA VGA boards with even greater screen sizes using
    the specific board drivers.

	The reason the screen driver and the keyboard driver are separate are
    historical. The original PCs from Greece had the character set in ROM, that
    meant that one only needed the keyboard driver.Since those are bloody
    expensive to import, one needs the screen driver also.

	 These programs do NOT work under windows.The windows system is different
    from plain vanilla DOS. But if you have loaded them before starting windows
    then whenever you start a DOS session they will be there waiting for you.

	      If you have already ran the programs then the following lines
    should be in greek.

	   Í§ £ß¶®úÂ´ú §ò õ†òô·©ú´ú ò¨´„ ´û ö®ò££„ ´Ê´ú °·´† °·§ò´ú ©‡©´·.
    í¶ ß¢„°´®¶ ö†ò ´Ê§¶¨™ úÂ§ò† ´¶ ";" , ö†ò õ†ò¢¨´†°· ´¶ ":" .

				HOW TO USE

	Simplicity itself. To switch between GREEK and ENGLISH , press and hold
    the CONTROL key down and press the minus "-" key. Careful not the minus on the
    numeric keypad but the one over the "{" key. The stress (´Ê§¶™) appears after a
    two key combination. First press the ";" key and then the letter you want to
    be stressed , the letter will appear stressed. Dialysis (õ†ò¢¨´†°·) work the
    same way, only the start key is now ":" which is the shifted version of ";".

	 If you want the ":" , or ";" to appear instead of stressing a letter just
    tap them twice, or tap a consonant ( ©Á£≠‡§¶ ) .

	If after exiting some application you try to type some GREEK but instead
    you get gibberish, then exit to DOS and issue the "SANE" command. That should
    reset the computer to bilingual operation.

			      WORD OF WARNING

	This is a SOFTWARE only product. This means that I had to patch MS/DOS which
    in turn means that not all applications will work with the GREEK characters.
       Well behaved applications that do not access the computer directly but go
    through DOS  should have no problems, other weird applications who knows.

    The lasejet font is called ALPHA.SFP load it on the printer using
    HPGREEK.BAT

	Beware some applications load completely new fonts each time you do
    something. Make sure you follow the documentation of each particular application
    pertaining to SOFT FONTS.Before buying this package make sure your
    COMPUTER/APPLICATION/PRINTER combination works with this GREEK.

			      ATTENTION èêéëéïÜ
	The proportional fonts will work for everything , but if you want
    nicely formatted tables, use SPACES instead of TABS.TABS try to adjust
    everything just to fine, and as a result they mangle up.

	The PANASONIC fonts have not been tested , so please if you find
    any problems contact me and I will somehow fix them.

	Lastly none of the greek printer fonts have the IBM block characters
    defined. Since I was time strained I put no effort in them. If I decide to
    define them in some future release , then there will be no update charges
    from me. If your local salesman demands some money talk straight to me.

	 A reminder : to use any or all of the above commands first CD into
    the subdirectory where the fonts reside , which is by default C:\VGAGREEK.

    Last words .

       Do NOT use ANSI.SYS. It is stupid it will NOT work for more than
       25 lines or 80 columns.

       If you need 132 column support for greek character sets please contact
       me personally.
